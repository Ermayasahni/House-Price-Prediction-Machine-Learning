House Price Prediction App

Tech Stack: Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit

Developed a comprehensive house price prediction system using 13 regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Huber Regressor, SGD Regressor, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), MLP Regressor (ANN), XGBoost, and LightGBM.
Performed detailed data preprocessing, feature scaling, and train–test splitting, and evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score to identify the best-performing algorithm. Automated the training and comparison pipeline, saved evaluation results to CSV, and serialized trained models using Pickle for deployment.

Designed an interactive Streamlit frontend that enables users to input property details and receive real-time house price predictions through a simple, user-friendly interface.
